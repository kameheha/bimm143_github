## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
candy_file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
candy
```



```{r}
colSums(candy)
nrow(candy)
```

Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?
ANS: 85
Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?
38

```{r}
#Prints out the winpercent of the candy category we are looking at
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
candy["Peanut M&Ms",]$winpercent
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```


Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

Ans: Favorite candy: Peanut M&MS, winpercent = 69.484%

Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

76.7686%

Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

49.6535%


```{r}
#install packaged skimr 
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```
Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Winpercent seems to be done on a different scale. N_missing and complete_rate also seem to be on a different scale of either true or false.


Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

0 means False,
1 means True
So whether the candy has chocoloate or not

Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
library (ggplot2)

ggplot (candy, aes(winpercent)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = "blue", color = "black") 
```



Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No

Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?
The center is below the 50%

```{r}
#changing my columns to logical values in chocolate
booleanchoco <- as.logical(candy$chocolate)
choc.rank<- candy [booleanchoco,]$winpercent
choc.rank
```
```{r}
booleanfruit <- as.logical(candy$fruity)
fruit.rank<- candy [booleanfruit,]$winpercent
fruit.rank
```

```{r}
#Averages of the values ablove

#Average for chocolate
mean(choc.rank)

#Average for Fruity
mean(fruit.rank)
```


Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?
Chocolate higher than fruit
60.92 > 44.12

```{r}
#Caculating P value. P value <0.05 shows statistical significance
t.test(choc.rank, fruit.rank)

```


Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

The difference is signifcant since p value is 2.871e-08 (less than 0.05)

```{r}
#Established from a lot of testing. (Top 5 are worst)
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
#Here just so i can cross reference whether my code above is truly the  favorite or worst candy.
sort (candy$winpercent)

#Last 5 of the favorite candy of everyone
tail(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```


Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chilets, Super Bubble, Jawbusters


Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, Reese's Miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, Snickers



Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot (candy, aes (winpercent, rownames (candy))) +
  geom_col()
```

Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by
winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot (candy, aes (winpercent, reorder (rownames (candy), winpercent))) +
  geom_col()
```
```{r}
#Color coordinating for graph below
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 
```

- Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?
Sixlets

- Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?
Starburst


```{r}
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 50)
```

Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's Minature


```{r}
#ordering the candy by price percent top to bottom
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```
Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

The 5 most expensive candy types are Nik L Nip, Nestle Smarties, Ring pop, Hershey's Krackel, Hershey's Milk Chocolate


```{r}
#install corrplot package
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

The two variables are anti-correlated are chocolate and fruity

Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

The most positively correlated variables are chocolate and winpercent.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)

```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```
```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```
```{r}
#Make a new data-frame with ur PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```
```{r}
library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 50)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```

```{r}
#install package plotly
library(plotly)
ggplotly(p)
```

```{r}
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```

Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive di-
rection? Do these make sense to you? 
Fruity, hard, pluribus.
